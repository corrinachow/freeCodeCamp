# JavaScript Calculator

This project is a response to the challenge "[Build a JavaScript Calculator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator)" at [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org).

The app fulfills the following user stories:

1) I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers.

2) I can clear the input field with a clear button.

3) I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
