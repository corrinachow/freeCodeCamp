# Twitch.tv JSON API

This project is a response to the challenge "[Use the Twitch.tv JSON API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)" at [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org).

The app fulfills the following user stories:

1) I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.

2) I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.

3) If a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.

**Hint #1**: See an example call to Twitch.tv's JSONP API at http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/use-the-twitchtv-json-api/19541.

**Hint #2**: The relevant documentation about this API call is here: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/reference/streams/#get-stream-by-user.
