# Wikipedia Viewer

This project is a response to the challenge "[Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer)" at [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org).

The app fulfills the following user stories:

1) I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.

2) I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

**Hint #1**: Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.

**Hint #2**: Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.

**Hint #3**: Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.
